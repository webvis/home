The goal of the Web Technology & Data Visualization research activity is to create open and rich software means to access data. Our intended users are scientists, decision makers, students, and the public at large.

We leverage the **innate power of the visual channel** and the **ubiquity of the Web platform** to:
- effectively communicate already known information in graphical form
- enable visual analysis tasks for the discovery of new knowledge
